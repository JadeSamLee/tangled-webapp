# Tangled
Tangled is a distributed ledger technology that uses a directed acyclic graph (DAG) data structure and blockchain data structure to achieve its goals of decentralization, transparency, and
immutability in the healthcare sector. DAGs offer a promising approach to improve the existing speed, scalability, and cost issues of blockchain technology and vice versa. Tangled is designed
for better data management with low latency, scalability and other process that could act as a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) on their own, providing transparency and accountability.
which makes it faster and more efficient than traditional systems.
